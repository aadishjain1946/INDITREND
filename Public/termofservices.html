                    We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part or content
                    thereof) without notice at any time.
                    We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension
                    or discontinuance of the Service.

                    <span style="color: black;"><strong>SECTION 5 - PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (if applicable)</strong></span>
                    Certain products or services may be available exclusively online through the website. These products
                    or services may have limited quantities and are subject to return or exchange only according to our
                    Return Policy.
                    We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and images of our products
                    that appear at the store. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of any color will
                    be accurate.
                    We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or Services to any
                    person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We
                    reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All
                    descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at anytime without notice, at the
                    sole discretion of us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for
                    any product or service made on this site is void where prohibited.

                    orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use
                    the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order,
                    we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e mail and/or billing address/phone number provided
                    at the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole
                    judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.

                    You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information for all
                    purchases made at our store. You agree to promptly update your account and other information,
                    including your email address and credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete
                    your transactions and contact you as needed.

                    any other materials, products, or services of third-parties.
                    We are not liable for any harm or damages related to the purchase or use of goods, services,

                    The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not
